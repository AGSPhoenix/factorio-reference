* Coal: 8 MJ
* Boiler efficiency: 50%
* Boilers consume 3.6 MW each
* = 1 coal per 2.2 seconds
Full boiler setup is:
 * 1 pump -> 20 boilers -> 40 steam engines
 * +20 burner inserters: each consumes 1 coal per 25 transfered
Each full boiler setup then consumes
 * 20 * (1 coal / 2.2 seconds + 1/25 coal / 2.2 seconds) = 9.5 coal / second
